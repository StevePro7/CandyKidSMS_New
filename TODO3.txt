CRITICAL
I must ensre that the level value is 4x chars wide NOT 5x because this overwrites 1x space in side tile

Sat morn and I am wait at airport for Glenn so I am going thru all the old TODO and README files and making short list of things I would like or must remember:

Joe Satriani albums as world names
very nice to have and will most likely not implement

commands
mover + speed
I just realized that I have speed for Kid but I haven't implemented speed for Mamas
I think I will just have on Hard difficulty level only with following logic
Pro	
Scatter		slow
Attack		fast

Adi
scatter		fast
attack		slow

Suz
flip coin 50/50 whether scatter or attack will be slow / fast accordinlgy
this is set each level

As there can be maximum frame index 65535 because is an int I need to implement a time over dead screen which is very simple

play_screen
check if frame >= 65535	MAX_INT and if so then goto time_screen
this pops up the middle section with the text TIME OVER
Kid loses a life and behaves just like the dead screen
i.e. if lives > 0 then ready screen else lives == 0 then cont screen


04.
I need to properly implement funky trees for the middle section popup and hide any sprites in the middle rectangle


05.
I need to complete the following screens
cont
over
pass

I need to implemnt the logic for pass
i.e. increment round and/or world

I need to tweak the delays btwn these screens for smooth flow


06.
IMPORTANT
I need to "prevent" Mamas from infinitely looping esp. in attack mode but I have seen in scatter mode
I have tried this before : it is every 4th move the total will be 15 because it is some combination of
up	01
down	02
left	04
right	08
total	15

if the 5th dirX = 1st dirX and total = 15 then this will potentially be a loop so I need an algorithm to break out of this cycle

maybe change the logic
i.e. check if only 1x direction first e.g. cul de sac and go oppX first then quit


maybe I could try this simple idea:
count the number of moves
assume that every 4th move will complete a cycle
therefore instead of looping thru direction list 0, 1, 2, 3 and doing check
could I loop backwards with the exact same check?
i.e.
3, 2, 1, 0 on every 4th move regardless of previous 3x moves and just assume it will be a cycle
this will be very easy to implement and test


07.
common sound FX must be moved to psg
for now I may just reuse all the music + sound from Platform Explorer
I'm not sure if I will have time to replace

Storage Manager
after select all options then save i.e. write changes to SRAM

also when quit game either thru easter egg or cont screen then write again just in case got hi score


09.
I think I may need to change the graphics and replace the tile manager as there is dup code there
I could try the new borders for game play


10.
Do I want to have two 14x14 arrays:
tile	14x14		foreach cell in 2D array stores the value of tile where 1 is only block tile
move	14x14		foreach cell in 2D array this has bit mask all moves can go from tile

This solution would create double the array but could remove all that upper/ lower nibble stuff
and in theory code would be more performant

This may be more work then is worth and would need to fully regression all game play = time consuming
one thing that I could do as halfway house is at minimum pre calc the border moves in the 2D array
and take out the code that calculates this

I had idea to make Mama go fast speed when go home on dead screen but I think that I'll leave out
