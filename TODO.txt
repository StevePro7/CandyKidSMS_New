02.
Separate out from play screen code to load screen
and move into the load screen accordingly


03.
check looping esp. in scatter mode e.g. level 90 something
we know that can loop indefinitely in attack mode so think
about the "algorithm" that I had to "break" the endlessness


04.
complete beat screen
detect for input to quit back title screen
OR when the timer runs out
also integrate the beat screen song


05.
refactor out play screen
collision code into collision manager
get_actor code into actor manager


06.
Kid tile collision is not resetting the level_object_tiles to <blank>


07.
TESTING collisions after changing the tile_type to include directions

check when mama goes into cul de sac still works



IMPORTANT
printing out the score while the game is playing is slowing the game down
i.e. can hear thru the music
so unless I can improve the efficient of the font print long function...?


DONE
01.
Storage Manager
confirm that the last byte write / erase is 0xFE
