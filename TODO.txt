01.
[re-]Test the death sequence and when no. lives go to zero as I refactored this;
should go to ready screen when >0 and con't screen when =0

02.
Move with boost
at first when Kid went thru exit on boost I did not subtract the boost
then I moved the code to update boost i.e. subtract boost value so works correctly
but then as soon as I did that I wondered about only taxing on hard level
this is easy to implement but I would have to overload the gamer move method
and call the second one on stop to wrap / move and deduct boost only if hard
for now it deducts boost on wrap / move for easy AND hard difficulty

when Kid dead and dead screen issue command to make Mamas choose fast speed to go home
when just before transitioning to next screen issue command to reset speed to slow

Tweak on dead / cont / over
do I want to reset the Mamas hands to stance i.e. 0 as they won't be moving??

02.
Separate out from play screen code to load screen
and move into the load screen accordingly


03.
check looping esp. in scatter mode e.g. level 90 something
we know that can loop indefinitely in attack mode so think
about the "algorithm" that I had to "break" the endlessness


04.
complete beat screen
detect for input to quit back title screen
OR when the timer runs out
also integrate the beat screen song


05.
refactor out play screen
collision code into collision manager
get_actor code into actor manager


06.
Kid tile collision is not resetting the level_object_tiles to <blank>


07.
TESTING collisions after changing the tile_type to include directions


Gamer collides with tile - check that draw blank works AND tile updates to blank OK
in all cases but still leaving the directions value as should be from before...



IMPORTANT
printing out the score while the game is playing is slowing the game down
i.e. can hear thru the music
so unless I can improve the efficient of the font print long function...?


DONE
01.
Storage Manager
confirm that the last byte write / erase is 0xFE




DONE
check when mama goes into cul de sac still works
