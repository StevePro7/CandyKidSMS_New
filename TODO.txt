01.
Storage Manager
confirm that the last byte write / erase is 0xFE


02.
Separate out from play screen code to load screen
and move into the load screen accordingly


03.
check looping esp. in scatter mode e.g. level 90 something
we know that can loop indefinitely in attack mode so think
about the "algorithm" that I had to "break" the endlessness


04.
complete beat screen
detect for input to quit back title screen
OR when the timer runs out
also integrate the beat screen song
